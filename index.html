    <h1>An animated visualization.</h1>
    <p>The visualization I found was a 3d mapping of Marvel characters. It shows how the different characters
    are related: family, enemy, friend and others. The first thing that stood out to me when i saw it
    was the usage of a d3.force() like layout. The characters are the nodes and the edges are the relationship.
    It only ever shows one force layout after you have selected a character. It maintains one force() until you reload the page. This
    requires there to be some sort of animation to remove connections. This wouldn't be quite as simple as
    removing one bar from a bar chart, because you dont want the data to be removed only the visualization.
    I dont know how you could make the force layout in 3 dimensions, but you could give the different nodes varying
    z-indecies. </p>
